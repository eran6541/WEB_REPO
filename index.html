  <p>What they don't tell you is that althought famous and expensive, this house was a structural failure. -10/10 The worst architect and house <strong>EVER</strong>. The rooftop garden Corbusier insisted upon weakened the already flimsy
    construction frame and allowed water to seep in through the ceiling. The owners of the house were a family of three who complained it "rained indoors"! Their small child developed severe turberculosis due to the humid
    condition of their home. When asked to take responsibilty for his failed design, Corbusier refused and insisted it was still an important contribution to the architecture world.</p>
