          <p>My name is Erika Andrade. I am Colorado born and raised and love to hike and spend time outdoors
            Among my many talents I draw, paint, and design buildings! I am an Environmentak Design major and I
            graduate this year. I am excited to finish my CTD minor this semester and continue on to work for an architecture
            firm after graduating while doing freelance graphic design.<p>
