  <p>World famous architect Le Corbusier designed and built this Villa as a manifesto of his 5 points of architecture.</p>

  <p>What they don't tell you is that althought famous and expensive, this house was a structural failure. -10/10 The worst architect and house <strong>EVER</strong>. The rooftop garden Corbusier insisted upon weakened the already flimsy
    construction frame and allowed water to seep in through the ceiling. The owners of the house were a family of three who complained it "rained indoors"! Their small child developed severe turberculosis due to the humid
    condition of their home. When asked to take responsibilty for his failed design, Corbusier refused and insisted it was still an important contribution to the architecture world.</p>
  <h2>The Failure</h2>
  <img src="assets/villasavoyefailure.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="destroyed villa"/>
  <p>The house was abandoned at the start of World War II and left to decay further than it was. There was even a time that German soldiers occupied it. Ultimately the house was demolished after years
    of neglect and initial bad design decisions. This may be Corbusier's most famous work, but its legacy is one of bad design and failure.</p>
