      <p> I am Colorado born and raised and I have 2 dogs: Mohave and Oso. I am a senior in the program of Environmental Design studying architecture and I
        am currently working on my senior thesis. I am also a CTD minor and I <strong>love</strong> anything that has to do with design. I love trying new mediums of design
      whether it is photography, coding, or now web design, I am really excited for the projects in this class. </p>

      <h2>Goals for this Class</h2>

        <p>1. Get a good grade to finish my minor in good standing.</p>
        <p>2. Make one good project for my design portfolio.</P>
