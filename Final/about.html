  <section id="bodytxt">
    <p id="abt2">I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder where
    I study architecture in the school of environmental design and
    creative technology design in the school of engineering. Outside of school
    work I like to paint and draw digitally. I aspire to work in the architecture
  field doing community projects and freelance graphic design and digital art.
I believe good and inclusive design can change lives and I want to be a part of that change
whether it is through architecture or visual art. </p>
